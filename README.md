Movie Theater Concessions

Write a program that displays a menu for a movie theater concessions counter. The main Menu should have the following options:
1. Concessions
2. Checkout
3. Manager

The Concessions option should display a new window or screen that shows the following options, allowing the user to enter or select the number of eacxh item they would like to purchase (taxes are included in the pricing):
- Small Popcorn: $3.00
- Medium Popcorn: $4.00
- Large Popcorn: $5.00
- Soda: $2.00
- Candy: $1.00
In addition to concession options and prices, the Concessions window or screen should also allow the user to go back to the Main Menu

The Checkout option should show the user a breakdown of each item possible to purchase, amount the user decided purachase, and the total cost for each item type as well as the total cost of all items. The program should then prompt for the user to enter how much money they will pay the total with, and then display the correct change given. The Checkout option should also have an option to return to the main menu. Once a user has gone through the checkout screen, the item totals should clear for a new user to use the Main Menu( so that the Checkout option no longer includes the previous user's totals).

The Manager option should display at any given point the total number of each item purchased by all users that day, along with the total gross sales from all purchases. The Manager option should only be displayed after a "password" key code has been entered. Use the following code: 7777.

This new window or screen should also display the highest test score as well as the lowest test score, and which test score number they are( if it were the first test score, the student entered, it would display Test #1)
